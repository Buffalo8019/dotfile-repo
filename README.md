<h2 align="center">ccxex29's dotfiles</h2>  
<p align="center">Dotfiles are files that usually live inside the dot directories (hidden directories) or are dots themselves (again, hidden). In Unix and Unix-like Operating systems, the dot(<code>.</code>) at the start of the file/folder name flags it as hidden by default. Configurations and personalization files are usually put as dotfile or dot directories, *which again, makes it hidden*. Hence the term "dotfile" was born.</p>
